-----QUESTION 1----- 
a. We are finding files in the /etc directory. We are redirecting the output of the command in one.txt and any errors in two.txt.
b. The file one.txt contains all the files in the /etc directory and the file two.txt contains all the errors that occurred.

-----QUESTION 2-----
1. March, 2006 with 15 channels
2. July, 2014 with 13 channels
3. August, 2014 with 12 channels

The command used to find it was this: cut -d ',' -f 20,21 'Global YouTube Statistics.csv' | sort -t ',' -k2M -k1n | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 3

Explanation:
I used cut to get the created_year and created_month columns.
-d ',' was used for comma delimiter, 
-f 20,21 was used to get the 20th and 21st columns (created_year and created_month).
 
For the sorting, -k2M sorts the second column by month, -k1n sorts the first column by number.

The command uniq -c was to get the count of each unique year/month combination.

Sort -nr sorts the list by descending order so the most frequent entries would appear at the top of the list.

head -n 3 displays the first 3 of the list.

Output of the command:
15 2006,Mar
13 2014,Jul
12 2014,Aug

-----Question 3-----
Command: ps -u davidsp24
Output:   
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
2339966 ?        00:00:05 systemd
2339968 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
2339974 ?        00:00:00 sshd
2339998 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
2386277 pts/0    00:00:00 ps

-----Question 4-----
Output while vim is running:
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
2339966 ?        00:00:06 systemd
2339968 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
2339974 ?        00:00:00 sshd
2339998 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
2388228 ?        00:00:00 sshd
2388231 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
2390227 pts/0    00:00:00 vim
2390381 pts/2    00:00:00 ps

Observations: There is a new sshd, bash, and vim process. The process ID for vim is 2390227.

Output after vim closes:
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
2339966 ?        00:00:06 systemd
2339968 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
2339974 ?        00:00:00 sshd
2339998 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
2388228 ?        00:00:00 sshd
2388231 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
2390925 pts/2    00:00:00 ps

Observations: The vim process is no longer part of the list. This is because we quit the vim in the other terminal.

-----Question 5-----
The init process is the first process that is started by the kernel during the boot process. It has a PID of 1.
It continues running until system shuts down. The role of init is to create processes by starting the scripts stored
in /etc/inittab.

The "ps aux" command could be used to view all running processes; the init process would be the first one on the list.

-----Question 6-----
The "ps aux" command is used for retrieving information about running processes.
It provides a comprehensive list of running processes that includes their PIDs, CPU and memory usage, the user under which
the process is running, and other important details.
The "aux" part of the command returns an output that displays the most amount of useful information to a user compared to other
similar options to the ps command.
